=================================
OWS Configuration - Layer Styles
=================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Styling Section
---------------

The "styling" sub-section of a `layer configuration section
<https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_layers.html>`_
contains definitions of the various styles
that layer supports.

Styles officially only apply to WMS and WMTS
requests. Datacube-OWS WCS GetCoverage requests will accept
a styles parameter, but this is not compliant with the
standard.  (I.e. an unofficial extension to the WCS standard).
Consequently, the "styling" section is always required,
even if WMS and WMTS services are deactivated.

The "styling" section has two entries: styles and default_style.

styles and default_style
========================

The "styles" list must be supplied, and must contain at least
one style definition.  There are several different types of style,
each with a slightly different syntax, these are discussed below.

The "default_style" entry is optional and identifies the style
that will be used by default if no style is specified in the
request.  If not supplied, it defaults to the first style definition in the
"styles" list.

E.g. Here the second style "another_style" is the default. If the
"default_style" entry were removed from this snippet, then the first
style "a_style" would be the default.

::

    "styling": {
        "default_style": "another_style",
        "styles": [
            { "name": "a_style", ... },
            { "name": "another_style", ... },
        ]
    }

Style Definitions
-----------------

Style Types
===========

There are four distinct possible types of style.

1. `Component Styles <https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_component_styles.html>`_

   Each component channel of the image (red, green, blue and optionally
   alpha) is calculated independently from the data for that pixel.

2. `Colour Map Styles <https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_colourmap_styles.html>`_

   Each pixel is mapped to one particular colour from a fixed pallet
   by applying a logical decision tree to the date for that pixel.

3. `Colour Ramp Styles <https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_colourramp_styles.html>`_

   A single continuous index value is calculated from the data for
   each pixel, and that index value mapped to a graduated colour ramp
   for display.

4. `Hybrid Styles <https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_hybrid_styles.html>`_

   A linear combination of a component style and a colour ramp style.

   This can allow for a more easily visually interpreted image, but
   there are usually better ways to achieve the same effect on the
   client side.

Each style type has its own specific config entries as described in the
pages linked above.

Inheritance
===========

Styles may be
`inherited <https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#configuration-inheritance>`_
from previously defined styles.

To lookup a style by name use the "style" and "layer" element in the inherits section.
(The layer section is optional and defaults to the layer of the new style:

::

    new_style = {
        "inherits": {
            "layer": "layer1",
            "style": "old_style"
        },
        "name": "new_style",
        "title": "New Style",
        ... # Other overrides.
    }

Note that a style can only inherit by name from a parent style that has already been parsed
by the config parser - i.e. it must appear earlier in the layer hierarchy.  This restriction
can be avoided using direct inheritance.


---------------
Common Elements
---------------

The following configuration elements are common to all style
types.

Name
++++

It is always required and must be unique within the layer.

E.g.::

    "styles": [
        {"name": "a_style", ...},       # Good.
        {"name": "My Style", ...},      # Poor. (Legal, but the space will need to
                                        # be escaped in URLs.
        {"name": "a_style", ...},       # Error - not unique in layer.
        {"name": "my_style_which_is_mine_and_nobody_elses", ...},
                                        # Poor. (Legal, but not concise)
    ]

Name, Title and Abstract
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The "name" is a symbolic name for the style, for use in request URLs and internally.

The "title" entry provides a short human-readable title for the style.

The "abstract" entry provides a longer human-readable description
of the style.

All three are always required and must be unique within the layer.

E.g.::

    "styles": [
        {
            "name": "simple_rgb",
            "title": "Simple RGB",
            "abstract": "Simple true-colour image, using the red, green and blue bands",
            ...
        },
        {
            "name": "ndvi",
            "title": "NDVI (red, nir)",
            "abstract": "Normalised Difference Vegetation Index - a derived index that correlates well with the existence of vegetation",
            ...
        },
    ]

Bit-flag Masks (pq_masks)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The "pq_masks" section allows a style to mask the output image
by the bit flags in any of the flag bands defined in the
`Flag Processing Section <https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_layers.html#flag-processing-section-flags>`_
for the layer.

The pq_masks entry is a list of mask definitions.  Each mask definition contains:

1. A ``band`` identifier, which refers to one of the flag-band identifiers defined in the
   `Flag Processing Section <https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_layers.html#flag-processing-section-flags>`_
   for the layer.
2. A mask rule, using the
   `OWS Masking Syntax <https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_masks.html>`_

The mask rules in the pq_masks list are AND'd together.
i.e. A pixel must match all of the mask rules in the list to remain visible.

E.g.

::

    # Remove pixels
    "pq_masks": [
        # A pixel is displayed if it matches all of the rules below.
        #
        # i.e. A pixel is masked out if it is masked out by any of the rules below.
        {
            # This rule matches pixels that are:
            #       1. Not Cloud.
            # AND   2. Not Cloud Shadow
            #       (According to the "pixelquality" band.)
            #
            # i.e. mask out pixels with cloud and/or cloud shadow.
            #
            "band": "pixelquality"
            "flags": {
                "cloud": "no_cloud",
                "cloud_shadow": "no_cloud_shadow"
            }
        },
        {
            # This rule matches pixels that are not water (according to the "pixelquality" band).
            #
            # i.e. mask out pixels that are land.
            #
            "band": "pixelquality",
            "invert": True, # Without invert, rule would match pixels ARE water.
            "flags": {
                "water": "water"
            }
        },
        {
            # This rule matches pixels with a non-zero "valid" band value.
            #
            # i.e. mask out pixels with zero validity.
            #
            "band": "valid",
            "invert": True, # Without invert, rule would match pixels with valid band equal to zero.
            "enum": 0,
        }

        # A pixel must match all of the rules above to be displayed.
        # (i.e. A pixel masked out by ANY of the above rules will be masked out.)
        #
        # So in this example, pixels are masked out if the are cloud, or cloud shadow, or water,
        # or invalid - all other pixels are displayed.
    ],


Feature Info Custom Style Includes (custom_includes)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In addition to the custom includes defined `at the layer level
<https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_layers.html#custom-layer-includes-custom-includes>`_,
custom includes can also be defined at the style level.  These are applied only if the GetFeatureInfo
request specifies a style, and override and entries defined at the layer level.

Style-level includes `behave identically
<https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_layers.html#custom-layer-includes-custom-includes>`_
to layer level ``custom-includes`` entries.

Legend
++++++

Describes the legend for the style.  Many options only apply for some
of the styles types and are discussed below with the relevant style type.

The following legend options are supported for all styles:

show_legend
@@@@@@@@@@@

If True, a legend url is returned for this style. If False, no legend
url is returned for the style.  Optional - defaults to True if a the
style type supports auto-legend generation, false otherwise.

If false no other legend configuration entries have any effect.

url
@@@

An external url pointing to an image file containing the legend. This
url will not be exposed directly to users, the image file will be
proxied behind an internal url.

The external image file MUST be in png format.

A url is required if `show_legend` is True and the style type does NOT
support auto-legend generation.

If the style type DOES support auto-legend generation, setting a url
deactivates legend generation.

E.g.::

     "legend": {
         "show_legend": True,
         "url": "https://somedomain.com/path/to/legend_image.png",
     }

If your instance of OWS
`supports multiple languages<https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#metadata-separation-and-internationalisation>`_
then you may supply separate urls pointing to different versions of the legend image for each of the configured
``supported_languages``.  In this case you MUST supply a legend image url for the default language
(the first language listed in the global ``supported_languages`` entry), and this url will be used for
any other supported languages for which you did not supply a specific url.

E.g. given supported languages (in the global section)::

    "supported_languages": [
        "en",      # The first language listed will be the default language.
        "fr",
        "de",
        "ar"
    ]

You can specify language specific legend urls with::

    "url": {
        "en": "http://myimages.com/this_product/this_style/default_english_legend.png",   # default legend image
        "fr": "http://myimages.com/this_product/this_style/french_legend.png",
        "ar": "http://myimages.com/this_product/this_style/arabic_legend.png",
        "it": "http://myimages.com/this_product/this_style/italian_legend.png",
    }

In the above example:

* the default english legend is used for English and German requests, as well as any language not in the
  supported_language list.
* French and Arabic requests will get their specific language legends.
* Italian is not a supported language, so the Italian url will be ignored.  Italian requests will get the default
  (English) legend.
* Removing the English url from the `urls` dictionary will result in an error as English is the default language.

multi_date
++++++++++

The WMS and WMTS specs allow queries over multiple date
values.  Datacube OWS will generally reject such queries as it
is generally not clear what such a query means in the
context of raster satellite data.

Datacube OWS does allow the user to define custom
extensions for individual styles to define the behaviour
of multi-date requests.  For example, selecting two
dates within a particular style might return a representation
of the difference between the data for those two dates.

Multi-date behaviour is configured using the ``multi_date``
entry which is a list of multi-date handlers.  `multi_date``
is optional and defaults to an empty list (no multi-date
handlers, single date requests supported only).

The format of a multi-date handler varies depending on the
`style type <#style-types>`__ but a multi-date handler must
always contain a ``allowed_count_range`` entry which specifies
the values for which the handler applies. The ``allowed_count_range``
is a tuple of two integers corresponding the minimum and maximum
number of dates accepted by that handler.  The allowed count ranges
of declared multi-date handlers cannot overlap and a multi-date handler
cannot handle a request with 1 (or 0) dates.

There is also an optional boolean entry ``preserve_user_date_order``.
The default value is False, which means the date dimension coordinates
of the Xarray dataset passed to the multidate handler at render time
will be as returned by ``dc.load`` - i.e. sorted in chronological order.
If ``preserve_user_date_order`` is set to True, then the date coordinates
of the dataset are resorted to match the date order passed in by the user
in the WMS request.

E.g. ::

    "multi_date": [
        {
            # This multi-date handler handles requests with 2 dates.
            "allowed_count_range": [2, 2],
            # No "preserve_user_date_order" specified - defaults to False.
            ...
        },
        {
            # This multi-date handler handles requests with between 3 and 5 dates.
            "allowed_count_range": [3, 5],
            # Preserve user-supplied date order.
            "preserve_user_date_order": True,
            ...
        },
        {
            # ERROR: 1 is not allowed, and 2 is already handled.
            "allowed_count_range": [1, 2],
            ...
        }
    ],

All styles support time-series animation as a multi-date handler, as discussed below.

Specific style types may support other forms of multi-date handlers. In particular,
`Colour Ramp styles <https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_colourramp_styles.html#multi-date-requests>`__
have additional specialised multi-date handler behaviour.

Time Series Animation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Time series animation is supported as a multi-date handler for all style subtypes. To enable, simply create
a multi-date handler with the "animate" flag set to True.  E.g.:

::

    "multi_date": [
        {
            "allowed_count_range": [2, 10],
            "animate": True,
            "frame_duration": 800,  #  0.8s per frame.
            "preserve_user_date_order": True,
        }
    ],

This returns an animated image in the Animated PNG format, with one frame per requested date value.  The
frame rate of the animation can be controlled with the optional ``frame_duration`` element, which is
measured in milliseconds and defaults to 1000 if not supplied.

Feature Info Multi-Date Custom Includes (custom_includes)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In addition to the custom includes defined `at the layer level
<https://datacube-ows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg_layers.html#custom-layer-includes-custom-includes>`_, and
`at the style level, as described above<#feature-info-custom-style-includes-custom-includes>`_,
If the GetFeatureInfo requests a style AND multiple dates, then the multi-date handler
can define additional custom feature info.

An additional dictionary is appended to the `properties::data` list, that already contains a dictionary
for each date returned by the query. The additional dictionary has ``"time": "all"`` and the fields
defined by the multi-date handler custom_includes entry.

Unlike other ``custom_include`` entries, the functions specified by the multi-date version is passed
a MULTI_DATE, single-pixel, multi-band ``xarray.Dataset``.  (Note that no ODC metadata is passed.)
