#. Equal Area projection (EPSG:3577). Data is only visible at higher

#. shaded region. Fractional cover provides information about the the
#. proportions of green vegetation, non-green vegetation (including deciduous
#. trees during autumn, dry grass, etc.), and bare areas for every 25m x 25m
#. ground footprint. Fractional cover provides insight into how areas of dry
#. vegetation and/or bare soil and green vegetation are changing over time. The
#. fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing
#. Research Program, for more information please see
#. data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractional+Cover
#. Fractional Cover products use Water Observations from Space (WOfS) to mask
#. out areas of water, cloud and other phenomena. To be considered in the FCP
#. product a pixel must have had at least 10 clear observations over the year.

#. (Version 2.1.5) includes observations taken from 1986 to the present, from
#. the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites. WOfS covers all of mainland Australia and
#. Tasmania but excludes off-shore Territories. The WOfS product allows users
#. to get a better understanding of where water is normally present in a
#. landscape, where water is seldom observed, and where inundation has occurred
#. occasionally. Data is provided as Water Observation Feature Layers (WOFLs),
#. in a 1 to 1 relationship with the input satellite data. Hence there is one
#. WOFL for each satellite dataset processed for the occurrence of water. The
#. details of the WOfS algorithm and derived statistics are available at
#. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.11.003. For service status information,
