# pylint: skip-file

# Example configuration file for datacube_ows.
#
# OVERVIEW
#
# This file forms the primary documentation for the configuration file format at this stage.
#
# The actual configuration is held in a single serialisable object that can be directly
# declared as a python object or imported from JSON.
#
# WHERE IS CONFIGURATION READ FROM?
#
# Configuration is read by default from the ows_cfg object in datacube_ows/ows_cfg.py
#
# but this can be overridden by setting the $DATACUBE_OWS_CFG environment variable.
#
# $DATACUBE_OWS_CFG is interpreted as follows (first matching alternative applies):
#
# 1. Has a leading slash, e.g. "/opt/odc_ows_cfg/odc_ows_cfg_prod.json"
#    Config loaded as json from absolute file path.
#
# 2. Contains a slash, e.g. "configs/prod.json"
#    Config loaded as json from relative file path.
#
# 3. Begins with an open brace "{", e.g. "{...}"
#    Config loaded directly from the environment variable as json (not recommended)
#
# 4. Ends in ".json", e.g. "cfg_prod.json"
#    Config loaded as json from file in working directory.
#
# 5. Contains a dot (.), e.g. "package.sub_package.module.cfg_object_name"
#    Imported as python object (expected to be a dictionary).
#    N.B. It is up to you that the Python file in question is in your Python path.
#
# 6. Valid python object name, e.g. "cfg_prod"
#    Imported as python object from named object in datacube_ows/ows_cfg.py
#
# 7. Blank or not set
#    Default to import ows_cfg object in datacube_ows/ows_cfg.py as described above.
#
# REUSING CHUNKS OF CONFIGURATION
#
# Often it is desirable to re-use chunks of configuration in multiple places.  E.g. a set
# of related data products may share a band index or style definition configurations.
#
# If you are loading config as a Python object, this is trivial, as demonstrated in this
# example file.
#
# If you want to reuse chunks of config in json, or wish to combine bits of json config
# with bits of python config, the following convention applies in both Python and JSON
# configuration:
#
# Any JSON or Python element that forms the full configuration tree or a subset of it,
# can be supplied in any of the following ways:
#
# 1. Directly embed the config content:
#       {
#           "a_cfg_entry": 1,
#           "another_entry": "llama",
#       }
#
# 2. Include a python object (by FQN):
#       {
#           "include": "path.to.module.object",
#           "type": "python"
#       }
#
#       N.B. It is up to you to make sure the included Python file is in your Python Path.
#            Relative Python imports are not supported.
#
# 3. Include a JSON file (by absolute or relative file path):
#       {
#           "include": "path/to/file.json",
#           "type": "json"
#       }
#
#       N.B. Resolution of relative file paths is done in the following order:
#           a) Relative to the working directory of the web app.
#           b) If a JSON file is being included from another JSON file, relative to
#              directory in which the including file resides.
#
# Note that this does not just apply to dictionaries. Either of the above include dictionaries
# could expand to an array, or even to single integer or string.
#
# THIS EXAMPLE FILE
#
# In this example file, there are some reusable code chunks defined at the top.  The actual
# config tree is defined as ows_cfg below the reusable chunks.
#

    # a valid alias.
